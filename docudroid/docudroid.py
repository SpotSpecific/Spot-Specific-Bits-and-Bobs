Docudroid (docudroid.py)

This script generates MediaWiki-compatible markup for JavaScript classes in conjuntion with jsdoc-toolkit and a set of suitable templates, then uploads the resulting files to a pre-defined namespace in a specified MediaWiki installation of choice.

The jsdoc-toolkit scripts and templates do all the heavily lifting. This script manages their invokation, and the editing of the wiki pages to reflect new content.

Usage:
	After setting configuration variables in the 'Configuration' section below, invoke the script from the shell without arguments, e.g.
		./docudroid.py
		or
		python docudroid.py
